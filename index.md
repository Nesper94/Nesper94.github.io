I am a biologist currently working in the [Grupo de Fundamentos y Enseñanza
de la Física y los Sistemas Dinámicos](https://fenfisdi.weebly.com/) and the
[Grupo de Biología Computacional](https://biologia-computacional.github.io/)
at the [University of Antioquia (UdeA)](https://www.udea.edu.co), Colombia.
I obtained my Master degree in Biology with emphasis on Systems Biology. I
also work as professor of the course of Genetics in the Institute of Biology
at the UdeA.

## Interests

I am mainly interested in the fields of Systems Biology, Molecular Biology,
Genetics and Bioinformatics. I am also an enthusiast of Linux and FOSS and
would like to learn more about programming and its applications to biology.
